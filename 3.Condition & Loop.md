### Conditions
* a group of commands to be excuted if someting is true
* in python we use if conditons
## If
``` py
if(1>0){
    print('1>0');
}
```
* if some condition is true then the line of code will be excuted.
* if not there are 3 options
    * nothing
    * `else`
    * `elif`

# nothing
* here the code does nothing and moves on  to the next line if the `if` condition is false

# else
* after the if block returns false we can wirte using `else`
``` py
if(0=1):
    print('this is supposed to happen')

else:
    print('this is supposed to happen')

```

# `elif`

* here the code will check the second condition that comes in the bracket after `elif`
``` py
if(0=1):
    print('this shouldnt happen')

elif(0>1):
    print('this shouldnt happen either')


```
* we can writed several `elif` codes under a an `if` block and we can either finish them by using nothing or `else`

### loop
* this is doing things over and over until a conditon is met or not met
* there are 2 main types

## 1)for
* this happens using a dictionary
``` py
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
    print('this will loop several times. oh yea and 'x' is a fruit');
```
## 2)while
* this is done in two methods
    * while
    * do...while
* the `do...while` means a block of code will be excuted first then the condition is checked
* the `while` on the other hand this will check if the condition are met and excute a block of code
